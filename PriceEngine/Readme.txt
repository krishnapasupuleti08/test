Attached 2 jsons in the project file to change the inputs.

database.json : file is to create part's price, which already has some test data that can be modified.

user-input.json : To give the user input.

This POC will serve as price engine which will calculate the price of the cycle according to the configuration provided.

Note:
High level components names were hard coded as : FRAME,HANDLE_BAR_WITH_BRAKES,SEATING,WHEELS,CHAIN_ASSEMBLY

Price changing with respect to time is considered as a monthly change, which can be extended to a date range further.

Thanks
Krishna Mohan.
